## 💡 What is Skill Swap?

**Skill Swap Platform** is a social learning and collaboration tool that allows individuals to **exchange skills directly** with one another.  
Instead of money, users trade knowledge — offering one skill while requesting to learn another.

🔁 Example: Someone offers **JavaScript** help and wants to learn **UI/UX Design** — they get matched with someone who fits the criteria.
